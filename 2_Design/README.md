# Components Description:

## ATmega328 :

- The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P is a low control, CMOS 8-bit microcontrollers created on the AVRÂ® enhanced RISC architecture. By executing commands in a single clock cycle, the devices achieve CPU amount impending one million instructions per second (MIPS) per megahertz, allowing the system designer to optimize power ingesting contrasted with processing rapidity.

## Power Supply :

- The Atmega328 can take 5.5V before you hazard damaging it. Subsequently you want to use a 9V battery, you will need some category of voltage regulation to push it down to satisfactory levels for the ATmega328.

## LCD Display :

- The displays available on the marketplace are based on the HD44780 normal. This normal means that the display supports almost all characters of the ASCII character table.
The display controller, which is combined in the display, can generate these characters and send them to the matrix. In addition to the previously 208 known letterings. The display controller holders most of the actions.

## LED :

- Light-emitting diode (LED) is a extensively used normal source of light in electrical equipment. They frequently find applications in campaigns that show the time and display dissimilar types of data.

## Temperature Sensor :

- A temperature sensor is a device, characteristically, a thermocouple or resistance temperature pointer, that provides temperature dimension in a legible form. A thermometer is the most basic form of a temperature meter that is used to amount the degree of hotness and coolness.

## Seat Sensor:

- The control expedient seat position sensor  is contactless, self-contained and completely wrapped against the environment. It sense the  seat temperature accordingly.
