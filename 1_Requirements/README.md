# Seat Temperature Monitoring System

## Seat Temperature Monitoring System : 
The seat temperature monitoring system is used to control the temperature of a vehicle seat.This system grants a Microcontroller(Atmega328) based Seat measurement system to perceive and confirm the presence/absence of person on the seat. In this system the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then the temperature need to be set consequently. 

When passengers or driver of the car gets seated on a car, the button sensor gets activate after that heater enabled. The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends analog value of temperature to the microcontroller. The microcontroller converts analog to digital values using ADC and display the digital value of temperature.


Based on the controller it will set the temperature and it is capable of upholding of heat in the vehicles seats. And whatever the heat is generated that point it will be displaying on displays.

# Features :

- EmbeddedC Based Programming.
- It perceive whether the person is seated or not.
- It is compitable.
- The digital value of temperature is visualized using Pulse Width Modulation(PWM).
- The corresponding temperature values displayed.
